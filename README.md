# Black Swan

**Black Swan** is an educational project currently under development, focusing on simulating fraud techniques, including AI-driven debt generation, to help understand digital fraud detection and prevention. The system is being built using **Rust** and **PostgreSQL** with plans for future enhancements.

---

## Features (Planned)
- **AI-Driven Debt Generation**: Create realistic, AI-powered debt notices.
- **Web Scraping**: Collect data from public sources for simulations.
- **Deepfake Technology**: Simulate realistic voice calls (future feature).
- **Fraud Detection**: Highlight vulnerabilities in modern fraud prevention systems.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Rust (for performance and security)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for structured data storage)
- **Sockets**: Currently working on socket communication for backend-client interaction
- **Web Scraping**: Python (Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium) for future integration

---

## Current Status
The project is under development. **Rust** is being used to build the backend, and I'm currently working on socket communication for the system's interactions. **PostgreSQL** is set up for data storage, and work is underway to integrate fraud detection features. More features, including AI-driven document generation and deepfake integration, will follow. Future updates will include web scraping, AI document generation, and integration of deepfake technologies.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blackswan.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    - Install **Rust**: Follow instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
    - Set up **PostgreSQL** for data storage.

3. **Run the project**:
    - Navigate to the `backend` folder and run the Rust backend:
      ```bash
      cargo run
      ```
